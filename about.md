Myro-cpp, short for My Robot (cpp), is software that enables you to easily program your own personal robot. 
Myro-cpp is based on the Python version of myro available at <www.roboteducation.org>, and it includes many features and functions for controlling the IPRE robot platforms, and trys to emulate the python api whenever possible. 
This library is used and developed for the Introduction to Computer Science (cs102) course at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.
